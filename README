If you're reading this, you've found my git repo for a project I worked on in the winter of 2012. This project was my final for a class called Philosophy of Technology at RIT.

You can see more on a page on my website at http://kaldrenon.com/?page_id=59, which is in sore need of updating, but has a link to the Prezi I made for the final presentation.

Feel free to contact me with any questions, preferrably at kaldrenon@gmail.com or at gplus.to/asfallows
